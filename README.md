## Wood Stock

To craft chairs, you first need to refine wood into 'Wood Stock' which is a stand-in for refined wood products. Wood Stock can be crafted at a normal crafting station, using the 'Woodworking' skill, and a scraping tool.

Here are the recipes:
 - Branch x1 = Wood Stock x1
 - Log x1 = Wood Stock x3

## Chairs/Building

Once you have some Wood Stock available, you can place the chairs. This requires the 'Wood Building' skill, as well as Wood Stock x6

After placing, your sapiens will enjoy to sit in the chairs. They have the highest comfort in the game, which will give your sapiens a good mood, and improve the happiness of your tribe.

### Variations

There are various material/model variations for the chairs, depending on the wood type you use. Experiment!
